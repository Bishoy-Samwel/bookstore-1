## About Project

"Bookstore CMS" is a content management React-Redux app that's meant to help a user add or remove books but most importantly keep tracking data in terms of progress made so far in reading a particular book.
This project uses [Bookstore API](https://www.notion.so/Bookstore-API-51ea269061f849118c65c0a53e88a739) for storage of book details data.
